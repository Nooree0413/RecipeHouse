(3, 'Mexican Hash Brown Stack', '2016-05-15', 'Mexican', 'Breakfast, or better yet, breakfast for dinner is served.			Though that recipe is equally as delicious in its own way, albeit very different, the two recipes do share something in common: a crispy potato base. In culinary school, we came to know this as a pommes darphin, but in reality, it is very similar to a large, round crispy hash brown.\n<p>								There are a few tricks to achieving a good hash brown base for this dish:\n</p>\n\n						\n						<p>\n								Grate the potato very quickly (as it will oxidize immediately) and work with just one potato (aka. one hash brown) at a time.\n								Do not soak the potato in water. You want to remove the excess moisture from the grated potato, but not the starch-as it will allow you to create a pancake-like hash brown that holds together.\n								Use a neutral, high-smoke point oil, such as grapeseed, safflower, or canola-or better yet, clarified butter-to cook the potato.\n								Watch the pan carefully, adjust the heat as necessary throughout the cooking process, and flip gently.\n								To keep the potatoes warm and crisp, hold them in a 275 degree oven (on a rack set on top of a baking sheet) as you prepare the rest of the recipe. No one likes a cold hash brown.\n						</p>\n						<p>\n								Mexican Hash Brown Stack. Crispy potato topped with sunny-side eggs, sliced avocado, homemade pico de gallo, and crumbled queso fresco cheese! \n								The hash brown base is the most technical aspect of this recipe. The rest comes together very quickly and is very straight-forward! Although you could easily buy a fresh pico de gallo from the store, you''d be surprised just how easy it is to make from scratch.\n\n								It takes just 10 minutes or so, tastes infinitely better, and if you''re anything like me during the summer months, you already have fresh tomatoes lying around on your kitchen countertop.\n\n								My only request is that you use fresh pico de gallo-and not jarred salsa-for this recipe. It''s a must!\n						</p>\n						<p>\n								The next step? Cook up the eggs! I topped the hash brown base with sunny-side eggs, but feel free to prepare them as you like. Easy over, fried, or poached would work just as well!\n						</p>\n						<p>	\n								Assemble.<br/><br/>\n\n								Devour.<br/><br/>\n\n								Repeat.<br/><br/>\n						</p>', '<br/>\n								<p>\n2-3 medium vine-ripened tomatoes (8 ounces), cored, de-seeded and diced<br/>\n										1/4 cup finely chopped red onion (roughly 1/4 medium onion)<br/>\n										1/4 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves, roughly chopped<br/>\n										1 tablespoon finely diced jalapeno pepper (de-seeded and ribs removed)<br/>\n										1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice (half a juicy lime)<br/>\n										kosher salt<br/>\n										freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n								</p>		\n								<p>		\n										<h3>Potato Tartine:</h3><br/>\n							\n										~1 lb - 1.25 lbs russet potatoes (roughly 1 small russet potato per serving)<br/>\n										kosher salt<br/>\n										freshly ground pepper<br/>\n										neutral-flavored oil, for cooking (canola, safflower, or grapeseed)<br/>\n								</p>		\n								<p>		<h3>Toppings:</h3><br/>\n\n										2 - 4 whole large eggs (1-2 per serving, depending on preference)<br/>\n										1/2 ripe avocado, thinly sliced<br/>\n										2 ounces queso fresco cheese, crumbled<br/>\n										fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish<br/>\n								\n								</p>', '2', '0 Hour 30 Minutes', '0 Hour 30 minutes', '1 Hour 00 minutes', '<ol>\r\n										<li>Prepare Pico de Gallo: Combine the ingredients in a small bowl, stir, and allow to sit out at room temperature as you prepare the rest of the recipe.</li><br/>\r\n										<li>Prepare Potato Tartine: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.

It is about celebrating life, cooking with wholesome, flavor-packed ingredients, and at the same time â€“ forgiving and allowing ourselves to enjoy that extra slice of chocolate cake or handful of fries.\n\n<p>It is elegant, yet simple. It is a little bit smoky and spicy (if you want to increase the spiciness, up the cayenne pepper!). It involves avocados. It takes less than 30 minutes to prepare start to finish.</p>\n<p>And lastly, it is topped with caramelized lime slices. I mean, how cool is that?
